Step-by-Step Guide

V.1.1 Preprocessing, Parsing, and Formatting

Parsing and Visualizing Data:

Load and explore EEG data using MNE.

Visualize raw data to understand its structure.

Filtering Data:

Filter the data to keep relevant frequency bands.
Re-visualize filtered data to ensure quality.
Feature Extraction:

Decide on features to extract (e.g., power of the signal by frequency and channel).
Use Fourier Transform or Wavelet Transform for spectral features.

V.1.2 Treatment Pipeline

Dimensionality Reduction:

Implement an algorithm like PCA, ICA, or CSP.
Test with existing scikit-learn and MNE algorithms first.
Classification:

Choose a classification algorithm from scikit-learn (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
Use pipeline objects (baseEstimator and transformerMixin) for integrating these steps.
Real-Time Simulation:

Create scripts for training and prediction.
Simulate a data stream and ensure predictions are made within 2 seconds.

V.1.3 Implementation

Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm:

Implement the chosen algorithm (e.g., CSP).
Create a transformation matrix to project data onto new axes that capture important variations.
Mathematical Foundations:

Utilize numpy or scipy for mathematical operations like eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition, and covariance matrix estimation.

V.1.4 Train, Validation, and Test

Cross-Validation:

Use cross_val_score to evaluate the classification pipeline.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Accuracy Requirement:

Ensure a mean accuracy of at least 60% on test data across all subjects.
